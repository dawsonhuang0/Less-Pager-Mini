# Triage flags — things a commit message says that I cannot confirm we do

Built by reading FULL commit messages (bodies, not subjects) of the 454
core-touching commits that have one, newest first. A flag means "unclear to
me", not "broken" — each needs a dig. Resolved flags move to a verdict in
`LEDGER.md`.

Status: `?` unresolved · `OK` verified match · `FIX` diverged and fixed · `GAP` diverged, open

## From commits 3100-3201 (v706..HEAD era)

| # | commit | what the message claims | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F01 | `9241325` [3194] | In a COMMAND table (unlike an env table), if a command is a prefix of a LATER command, the later longer one must win — the user deliberately overrode it. Chain: `fd09752` → `8f951a3` → reverted `df70e7a` → this. | ? |
| F02 | `df53ea6` [3187] | `getchr()` must treat `iread()` returning 0 (tty EOF) as fatal and `quit(QUIT_ERROR)`, else it busy-loops forever. Note [3186] reverts an earlier attempt at this. | ? |
| F03 | `7c85230` [3184] | Failure EXIT STATUS in three cases: missing filename when stdin is a tty; missing option argument (`less -b`); no input file openable in non-interactive mode. | **OK** ran both binaries: `-b` -> 1/1, unopenable file -> 1/1. Third case (no filename, stdin a tty) not exercised. |
| F04 | `81ba76f` [3182] | `POSIXLY_CORRECT` must be read with `getenv`, NOT `lgetenv` — it is true if set to ANY value including the empty string. | **OK** `cli.ts:90` uses `actualEnv(...) !== undefined` (raw env, empty counts). |
| F05 | `9f2e50f` [3157] | `#` and `%` expansion in `:e` and `!` must be SHELL-ESCAPED (#784). | ? |
| F06 | `254fefb` [3153] | An unterminated OSC sequence must have the ENTIRE sequence removed, not be closed with a synthesised ST. | **FIX** — we passed it through RAW (older than either og behaviour), leaking the sequence and the text it swallowed. Fixed in `helpers.ts` transformLine. Verified vs og on `/tmp/osc-unterm.txt`. |
| F07 | `f65bf48` [3139] | Color descriptors loosened: color part may be omitted entirely (`-DNd`, not just `-DN-d`), and a dot with empty background is allowed (`-DN43.`). | **OK** `-DNd`, `-DN-d`, `-DN43.`, `-DN43.5` all accepted by both. |
| F08 | `b2ae157` [3136] | After the end of OSC 8 link text, the last escape sequence must be re-sent (matters when `-DO` gives links a real color). | ? |
| F09 | `604a1f0` [3133] | OSC 8 underlining is ORTHOGONAL to coloring: it must not set `in_hilite` and must not resend escapes at its end (search hilite must). Also: OSC 8 sequences must not be saved as resendable. | ? |
| F10 | `c654d98` [3132] | Emit the null OSC 8 sequence at end of line only when actually MID-LINK, not when any link appeared anywhere in the line. | **GAP** — measured: on an unterminated OSC 8, og ends the line with `ESC[m ESC]8;; ESC\\` (attr reset + null OSC 8 closing the link); we emit neither. So we never close an open link at EOL. Needs `in_osc8_link` state in the transform. |
| F11 | `4e4dce3` [3121] | `G` at the end of &-filtered input must still ring the bell when the file's last line is filtered OUT (#774). | ? |
| F12 | `7649e1d` [3120] | `jump_forw` must set `soft_eof` to the end of FILTERED input so `(END)` shows after `G` under a filter (#774). | ? |
| F13 | `bbc23b6` [3112] | OSC 8 mouse click on a link that wraps across screen lines must search from the start of the FILE line, not the screen line (#775). | ? |
| F14 | `96c8eb9` [3110] | `LESS_OSC8_OPEN_ANY` (one handler) replaces `LESS_OSC8_OPEN_file`/`_man`. | **OK** `osc8.ts:162` falls back to `LESS_OSC8_OPEN_ANY`. |
| F15 | `3e11cb4` [3109] | Do NOT prompt-expand `LESS_OSC8_OPEN_xxx`; just append the shell-escaped URI. | **OK** `osc8.ts:175` builds `${handler} ${shellQuote(uri)}` and nothing else. |
| F16 | `c082728` [3108] | OSC 8 scheme is LOWERCASED to find the handler var; a URI with no colon uses `LESS_OSC8_OPEN_NONE`. | **OK** `osc8.ts:159` `colon < 0 ? 'NONE' : uri.slice(0,colon).toLowerCase()`. |
| F17 | `d5122e3` [3183] | `J`, `K` and `Y` must appear on the help screen (#796). | **OK** `startup/lessHelp.ts:25-26` matches `less/less.hlp:16-17` verbatim. |
